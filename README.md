## 🚀 Unique Features

These are planned extensions to make the app even more powerful:

- **Real-Time Market Price Integration:** Pulls live market prices for the identified catch based on the user's location, providing instant knowledge of its value for strong bargaining power.
- **Restricted & Endangered Species Alert:** Instantly alerts the user with a visual warning if an endangered or legally undersized fish is detected, helping prevent fines and support conservation.
- **AI-Powered Image Upscaling:** Enhances blurry or low-resolution photos from the gallery using an AI model, improving analysis accuracy on poor-quality uploaded images.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, native Android stack.

- **Frontend:**
  - **Kotlin:** The primary, modern language for native Android app development.
  - **Jetpack Compose:** The declarative UI toolkit for building a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Data and AI/ML:**
  - **TensorFlow Lite:** The core framework for deploying and running highly optimized machine learning models directly on the Android device.
  - **Python (with TensorFlow/Keras):** Used for training and converting the AI models before mobile deployment.
- **Database:**
  - **SQLite & Room:** For robust, on-device, offline data storage and management.
- **Integration and APIs:**
  - **CameraX API:** For accessing and managing the device's camera feed to process live video frames.
  - **Android Location Services (GPS):** For automatic geotagging of every catch log.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** (Hedgehog 2023.1.1 or newer is recommended)
- **JDK 17** (This is now bundled with the latest versions of Android Studio)
- An Android device or emulator running **API level 26 or higher**.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
    *(Replace the URL with your actual repository link)*

2.  **Download the AI Model**
    This project requires a TensorFlow Lite object detection model.
    - Download a pre-trained model like `yolov8n_float16.tflite`.
    - Place the downloaded `.tflite` file inside the `app/src/main/assets/` directory. **The app will not build without a model file here.**

3.  **Open in Android Studio**
    - Open Android Studio.
    - Click on `File > Open` and select the cloned project directory.
    - Wait for Gradle to sync all the project dependencies.

4.  **Run the Application**
    - Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
    - Click the 'Run' button (▶️) in Android Studio.

## 🧠 AI/ML Models

The core of this application is a pipeline of on-device TFLite models:

1.  **Object Detection:** Uses a lightweight model like **YOLOv8-Tiny** or **MobileNet-SSD** to find the location of each fish in the camera frame.
2.  **Species Classification:** A cropped image of each detected fish is passed to an efficient classification model like **EfficientNet-Lite** to identify the species.
3.  **Health Assessment:** The same cropped image is passed to a custom-trained **MobileNetV3** model to assess freshness and quality based on visual indicators.
